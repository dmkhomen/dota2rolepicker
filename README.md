Check it out at [dmkhomen.github.io/dota2rolepicker/!](https://dmkhomen.github.io/dota2rolepicker/) (hosted with Github Pages)
Made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

### Description
This is a tool to help pick hero during strategy time. Use: filter by role, check out what damage type is needed (seek to balance physical and magical damage in your team), try to get melee-range pairs as core-supports on laning phase, filter by your favorite heroes if you have any (you have to add them by clicking on portrait).
