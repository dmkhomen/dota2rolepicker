# Dota 2 Hero Role Picker

[Check it out! (hosted with Github Pages)](https://dmkhomen.github.io/dota2rolepicker/)

## Description
This is a tool to help pick hero during strategy time. Use: filter by role, check out what damage type is needed (seek to balance physical and magical damage in your team), try to get melee-range pairs as core-supports on laning phase, filter by your favorite heroes if you have any (you have to add them by clicking on portrait).

Made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
